Telegram Movie Bot
Introduction
This Telegram Movie Bot is a simple and interactive bot created using Node.js and the node-telegram-bot-api library. It allows users to search for movie information directly through a Telegram chat. By utilizing the TMDb (The Movie Database) API, the bot retrieves essential movie details, such as the title, release date, and an overview, making it a convenient tool for movie enthusiasts who want quick information on movies without leaving the Telegram platform.

Features
Real-time Movie Search: The bot fetches and displays movie information based on user queries.
Simple Start Command: Users can initiate the bot by typing /start, which sends a welcome message explaining how to use the bot.
Error Handling: Handles errors from API requests gracefully and notifies the user if the movie isn’t found.
Polling-based Updates: The bot uses polling to actively listen for messages, ensuring prompt responses to user inputs.
Project Structure
index.js: Contains the main logic for setting up the bot, handling commands, and making requests to the TMDb API.
package.json: Manages the project's dependencies, including node-telegram-bot-api and axios for HTTP requests.
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed (preferably version 14 or above).
Telegram Bot Token: You’ll need to create a bot on Telegram and obtain an API token from BotFather.
TMDb API Key: Sign up at TMDb and get an API key to enable movie searches.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-repository-name
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up API keys: Replace your Telegram bot token and TMDb API key in index.js:

javascript
Copy code
const botToken = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN';
const tmdbApiKey = 'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY';
Usage
Start the bot:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Interact with the bot on Telegram:

Open a chat with your bot in the Telegram app.
Type /start to initiate interaction.
Enter the name of any movie to get details. The bot will return the title, overview, and release date of the first search result.
Code Explanation
The code is built in JavaScript using Node.js. Here’s a brief overview:

Bot Initialization: The bot is initialized with the polling option, enabling it to continuously listen for user messages.
API Call (searchMovie): The searchMovie function constructs a request to the TMDb API, searches for the movie by title, and returns the first result if found. In case of an error, it returns an appropriate error message.
Message Handling: When a message is received, the bot checks if it’s a /start command or a movie title. For movie titles, it fetches the movie details from TMDb and sends them back to the user.
Future Enhancements
Consider adding these features:

Enhanced Search: Provide additional search filters like genre, release year, or ratings.
Inline Queries: Enable inline queries, allowing users to search for movies from any chat.
Additional APIs: Integrate with other movie APIs for richer information, like Rotten Tomatoes scores.
User Ratings: Allow users to rate movies and store those ratings.
Dependencies
node-telegram-bot-api: Handles communication with the Telegram API.
axios: Makes HTTP requests to the TMDb API for retrieving movie data.
